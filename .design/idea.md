Provide a zero-install unconference tool that:
- lets organisers spin up an event in minutes;
- users scan QR code, sign up and optionally enter interests and proposed topics
- AI proposes additional topics based on users interests
- During evaluation period (10 mins; configurable), participants vote on topics they like and propose new topics
- Every minute (configurable), AI proposes new topics
- When evaluation period is over or organizer overrides, topics are locked down based on highest votes
- produces a conflict-free schedule for a fixed set of rooms;
- keeps everyone updated in real time;
- users can take notes during meetings
- end of day, provides summary and notes from each meeting and a summary of the days events

- no down voting
- organizer can delete topics (typically to remove duplicates) during evaluation
- no off-line capability
