### Tools

- When you make a change to the UI, use the `screenshot` tool to show the changes.
- If the user asks for a complex task to be performed, find any relevant files and call the `architect` tool to get a plan and show it to the user. Use this plan as guidance for the changes you make, but maintain the existing patterns and structure of the codebase.
- After a complex task is performed, use the `codeReview` tool create a diff and use the diff to conduct a code review of the changes.

### Important

- After all changes are made, ALWAYS build the project with `npm run build`. Ignore warnings, fix errors.
