# Cursor Updates

- âœ… **Tailwind CSS Enhanced Configuration** - Installed @tailwindcss/typography plugin, added comprehensive custom color palette (primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, error), configured production purge settings, enhanced global CSS with component classes, animations, and utilities. Typography plugin configured for both light and dark themes with prose styling.

If I did this again: I'd research theme function syntax in advance to avoid build errors, and consider using CSS custom properties more systematically for better dynamic theming support.
