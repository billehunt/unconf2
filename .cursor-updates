# Cursor Updates

- ✅ **Tailwind CSS Enhanced Configuration** - Installed @tailwindcss/typography plugin, added comprehensive custom color palette (primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, error), configured production purge settings, enhanced global CSS with component classes, animations, and utilities. Typography plugin configured for both light and dark themes with prose styling.

**Rule for future projects:** Research Tailwind theme function syntax before configuration to avoid build errors. Use CSS custom properties systematically for dynamic theming support rather than hardcoded values.

- ✅ **ShadCN UI & Lucide Icons Integration** - Installed lucide-react icons library, initialized ShadCN UI with New York style and neutral base color, installed essential components (Button, Card, Input, Badge), created comprehensive showcase component demonstrating all features, verified tree-shaking is working (9/11 used icons found, minimal unused icons), set up proper theme extension with CSS custom properties, and confirmed build optimization.

**Rule for future projects:** Set up tree-shaking verification scripts early in development to catch bundling issues. Use sophisticated bundle analyzers for performance insights and optimization opportunities.

- ✅ **Supabase Project Infrastructure** - Installed @supabase/supabase-js client, created environment configuration structure with validation, set up Supabase client with proper error handling, created comprehensive setup documentation, built connection testing component with real-time status updates, added setup page at /setup for verifying configuration, and ensured build passes with proper TypeScript types.

**Rule for future projects:** Create CLI setup wizards to automate environment file creation and improve developer onboarding experience. Reduce manual configuration steps wherever possible.

- ✅ **Prisma Database Integration** - Installed Prisma and @prisma/client, configured schema.prisma for Supabase PostgreSQL with connection pooling, created Prisma client utilities with connection testing, added database scripts to package.json (db:generate, db:studio, db:push, db:migrate, db:reset), created API endpoint for connection testing, built connection test component with environment validation, updated setup page with database status checking, and ensured build passes with proper error handling.

**Rule for future projects:** Configure database connection pooling from project start rather than as an afterthought. Create automated schema synchronization scripts to maintain consistency across environments.

- ✅ **Supabase + Prisma Connection Resolution** - Diagnosed and resolved IPv6 connectivity issues in WSL2 environment by switching from direct database connection to Supabase's connection pooler, updated connection strings to use aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com instead of direct db host, enhanced error logging and diagnostics for better troubleshooting, verified both Supabase API and Prisma database connections working successfully, and ensured build passes with proper connection pooling parameters.

**Rule for future projects:** Document WSL2 IPv6 connectivity limitations upfront in project setup docs. Default to connection pooler URLs immediately for better developer experience in containerized environments.

- ✅ **Automated Database Migration System** - Implemented comprehensive CI/CD-ready migration automation with enhanced npm scripts using dotenv-cli for .env.local loading, created robust bash script with environment detection and error handling, built TypeScript seed system with sample data, added extensive documentation with GitHub Actions examples, and verified complete workflow including dry-run testing, migration status verification, and production build compatibility.

**Rule for future projects:** Configure dotenv-cli from the beginning to avoid environment variable loading issues between different tools. Create separate staging database environments early for safer CI/CD testing workflows.

- ✅ **Centralized Logging & Error Boundary System** - Implemented comprehensive logging infrastructure with structured output for development and production, created multi-level React error boundaries (page/section/component) with user-friendly fallbacks, built global error handler for unhandled promise rejections and exceptions, integrated logging into existing Prisma and Supabase libraries, and provided interactive demo components for testing error handling and logging functionality in development.

**Rule for future projects:** Implement logging infrastructure early in the development process to capture detailed debugging information from the start. Create standardized error message patterns for consistent user experience across all error boundaries.
