# Cursor Updates

- ✅ **Tailwind CSS Enhanced Configuration** - Installed @tailwindcss/typography plugin, added comprehensive custom color palette (primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, error), configured production purge settings, enhanced global CSS with component classes, animations, and utilities. Typography plugin configured for both light and dark themes with prose styling.

If I did this again: I'd research theme function syntax in advance to avoid build errors, and consider using CSS custom properties more systematically for better dynamic theming support.

- ✅ **ShadCN UI & Lucide Icons Integration** - Installed lucide-react icons library, initialized ShadCN UI with New York style and neutral base color, installed essential components (Button, Card, Input, Badge), created comprehensive showcase component demonstrating all features, verified tree-shaking is working (9/11 used icons found, minimal unused icons), set up proper theme extension with CSS custom properties, and confirmed build optimization.

If I did this again: I'd set up the tree-shaking verification script earlier to catch any bundling issues during development, and potentially use a more sophisticated bundle analyzer for deeper insights.

- ✅ **Supabase Project Infrastructure** - Installed @supabase/supabase-js client, created environment configuration structure with validation, set up Supabase client with proper error handling, created comprehensive setup documentation, built connection testing component with real-time status updates, added setup page at /setup for verifying configuration, and ensured build passes with proper TypeScript types.

If I did this again: I'd create a CLI setup wizard to automate the environment file creation and provide better developer onboarding experience.

- ✅ **Prisma Database Integration** - Installed Prisma and @prisma/client, configured schema.prisma for Supabase PostgreSQL with connection pooling, created Prisma client utilities with connection testing, added database scripts to package.json (db:generate, db:studio, db:push, db:migrate, db:reset), created API endpoint for connection testing, built connection test component with environment validation, updated setup page with database status checking, and ensured build passes with proper error handling.

If I did this again: I'd set up database connection pooling configuration from the start and create automated schema synchronization scripts.

- ✅ **Supabase + Prisma Connection Resolution** - Diagnosed and resolved IPv6 connectivity issues in WSL2 environment by switching from direct database connection to Supabase's connection pooler, updated connection strings to use aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com instead of direct db host, enhanced error logging and diagnostics for better troubleshooting, verified both Supabase API and Prisma database connections working successfully, and ensured build passes with proper connection pooling parameters.

If I did this again: I'd document the WSL2 IPv6 connectivity limitation upfront and default to connection pooler URLs immediately for better developer experience in containerized environments.
