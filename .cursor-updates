# Cursor Updates

- ✅ **Tailwind CSS Enhanced Configuration** - Installed @tailwindcss/typography plugin, added comprehensive custom color palette (primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, error), configured production purge settings, enhanced global CSS with component classes, animations, and utilities. Typography plugin configured for both light and dark themes with prose styling.

**Rule for future projects:** Research Tailwind theme function syntax before configuration to avoid build errors. Use CSS custom properties systematically for dynamic theming support rather than hardcoded values.

- ✅ **ShadCN UI & Lucide Icons Integration** - Installed lucide-react icons library, initialized ShadCN UI with New York style and neutral base color, installed essential components (Button, Card, Input, Badge), created comprehensive showcase component demonstrating all features, verified tree-shaking is working (9/11 used icons found, minimal unused icons), set up proper theme extension with CSS custom properties, and confirmed build optimization.

**Rule for future projects:** Set up tree-shaking verification scripts early in development to catch bundling issues. Use sophisticated bundle analyzers for performance insights and optimization opportunities.

- ✅ **Supabase Project Infrastructure** - Installed @supabase/supabase-js client, created environment configuration structure with validation, set up Supabase client with proper error handling, created comprehensive setup documentation, built connection testing component with real-time status updates, added setup page at /setup for verifying configuration, and ensured build passes with proper TypeScript types.

**Rule for future projects:** Create CLI setup wizards to automate environment file creation and improve developer onboarding experience. Reduce manual configuration steps wherever possible.

- ✅ **Prisma Database Integration** - Installed Prisma and @prisma/client, configured schema.prisma for Supabase PostgreSQL with connection pooling, created Prisma client utilities with connection testing, added database scripts to package.json (db:generate, db:studio, db:push, db:migrate, db:reset), created API endpoint for connection testing, built connection test component with environment validation, updated setup page with database status checking, and ensured build passes with proper error handling.

**Rule for future projects:** Configure database connection pooling from project start rather than as an afterthought. Create automated schema synchronization scripts to maintain consistency across environments.

- ✅ **Supabase + Prisma Connection Resolution** - Diagnosed and resolved IPv6 connectivity issues in WSL2 environment by switching from direct database connection to Supabase's connection pooler, updated connection strings to use aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com instead of direct db host, enhanced error logging and diagnostics for better troubleshooting, verified both Supabase API and Prisma database connections working successfully, and ensured build passes with proper connection pooling parameters.

**Rule for future projects:** Document WSL2 IPv6 connectivity limitations upfront in project setup docs. Default to connection pooler URLs immediately for better developer experience in containerized environments.

- ✅ **Automated Database Migration System** - Implemented comprehensive CI/CD-ready migration automation with enhanced npm scripts using dotenv-cli for .env.local loading, created robust bash script with environment detection and error handling, built TypeScript seed system with sample data, added extensive documentation with GitHub Actions examples, and verified complete workflow including dry-run testing, migration status verification, and production build compatibility.

**Rule for future projects:** Configure dotenv-cli from the beginning to avoid environment variable loading issues between different tools. Create separate staging database environments early for safer CI/CD testing workflows.

- ✅ **Centralized Logging & Error Boundary System** - Implemented comprehensive logging infrastructure with structured output for development and production, created multi-level React error boundaries (page/section/component) with user-friendly fallbacks, built global error handler for unhandled promise rejections and exceptions, integrated logging into existing Prisma and Supabase libraries, and provided interactive demo components for testing error handling and logging functionality in development.

**Rule for future projects:** Implement logging infrastructure early in the development process to capture detailed debugging information from the start. Create standardized error message patterns for consistent user experience across all error boundaries.

# Implemented Complete Data Model Schema for Unconf2

Successfully defined all core database models for the unconference platform: Event, Room, TimeBlock, Topic, Attendee, Vote, Session, and Note. Each model includes proper relationships, constraints, and snake_case table mapping. Created comprehensive seed script with demo data including one event, two rooms, three time blocks, sample topics, one test attendee, and demonstration votes. All models follow PostgreSQL best practices with UUID primary keys, proper foreign key relationships, and soft delete capability for topics.

**Rule for future projects:** When designing complex relational schemas, define all models together in a single session to ensure proper relationship mapping and avoid circular dependency issues. Always create the seed script immediately after the schema to validate the relationships work correctly before proceeding to application logic.

# Data Modeling Phase Complete - Critical Prisma & Environment Learnings

Completed all 9 data modeling tasks including Event, Room, TimeBlock, Topic, Attendee, Vote, Session, and Note models with full relational constraints. Successfully migrated from placeholder User model to complete unconference schema. Created seed script with realistic demo data and verified database connectivity. Build passes and all changes committed.

**Critical Environment Variable Learning:** Prisma Studio requires explicit environment loading via `npm run db:studio` (which uses `dotenv -e .env.local`) rather than direct `npx prisma studio` commands. The latter only loads `.env` files, missing critical Supabase credentials in `.env.local`. This caused "fetch failed" errors in Studio UI until proper environment loading was used.

**Migration Workflow Insight:** When replacing existing models entirely, create new migration with `npm run db:migrate -- --name "descriptive-name"` rather than attempting to modify existing migrations. Prisma correctly handles dropping old tables and creating new ones with proper foreign key constraints.

**Rule for future projects:** Always use project-specific npm scripts for Prisma commands (db:studio, db:migrate, db:seed) rather than direct npx commands, as they ensure proper environment variable loading. Set up database testing early with both Prisma Studio and API endpoints to validate connectivity from multiple angles. Document environment setup clearly to avoid credential overwrites during template copying.

# Implemented AppShell with Complete UI Foundation

Successfully created comprehensive AppShell component with sticky header, responsive container, toast notifications, and dark mode toggle. Integrated next-themes for theme management with system preference detection. Header includes placeholder navigation and branding with proper responsive design. Toast system uses ShadCN components with proper accessibility. Dark mode toggle provides light/dark/system options via dropdown menu.

**Component Architecture Insight:** AppShell pattern provides clean separation of layout concerns from page content. Sticky header with backdrop blur gives modern glassmorphism effect while maintaining readability. Toast positioning outside main content prevents layout shifts during notifications.

**Rule for future projects:** Install theme management early in development to avoid hydration issues later. Use ShadCN component patterns consistently for UI cohesion. Structure app shell to be layout-agnostic so individual pages don't need to handle common UI elements like headers, footers, or notifications.
