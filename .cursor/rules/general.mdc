### Project Details

- you can find the PRD for this project in [prd.md](mdc:prd.md). Be sure to read it when you need an overall idea of what the project is about.

### Components & Naming

- Use functional components with `"use client"` if needed.
- Name in PascalCase under `src/components/`.
- Keep them small, typed with interfaces.
- Use Tailwind and ShadCN for common UI components like textarea, button, etc.

### Prisma

- Manage DB logic with Prisma in `prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/lib/db.ts`.
- snake_case table → camelCase fields.
- No raw SQL; run `npx prisma migrate dev`, never use `npx prisma db push`.

### Icons

- Prefer `lucide-react`; name icons in PascalCase.
- Custom icons in `src/components/icons`.

### Next.js Structure

- Use App Router in `app/`. Server components by default, `"use client"` for client logic.
- NextAuth + Prisma for auth. `.env` for secrets.

### TypeScript & Syntax

- Strict mode. Avoid `any`.
- Use optional chaining, union types (no enums).

### File & Folder Names

- Next.js routes in kebab-case (e.g. `app/dashboard/page.tsx`).
- Shared types in `src/lib/types.ts`.
- Sort imports (external → internal → sibling → styles).

### AI

- Use OpenAI for all AI calls.
- Use GPT-4.1 model for streaming and o3 model for reasoning.

### Storybook

- Place stories in `src/stories` with `.stories.tsx` extension.
- One story file per component, matching component name.
- Use autodocs for automatic documentation.
- Include multiple variants and sizes in stories.
- Test interactive features with actions.
- Use relative imports from component directory.

### Additional

- Keep code short; commits semantic.

### IMPORTANT:

- At the end of every agent interaction, always append to `.cursor-updates` file in markdown format:
   - a H1 one-sentence summary of changes you made
   - a concise note to yourself of what you would do differently if you performed this task again
- If you forget, the user can type the command "finish" and you will run the build and update `.cursor-updates`.
- Finally, update git with `git add . && git commit -m "..."`. Don't push.
