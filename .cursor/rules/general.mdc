### Project Details

- you can find the PRD for this project in `.prd.md` Please read it whenever you need an overall idea of what the project is about.

### Components & Naming

- Use functional components with `"use client"` if needed.
- Name in PascalCase under `src/components/`.
- Keep them small, typed with interfaces.
- Use Tailwind and ShadCN for common UI components like textarea, button, etc.

### Prisma

- Manage DB logic with Prisma in `prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/lib/db.ts`.
- snake_case table → camelCase fields.
- No raw SQL; run `npx prisma migrate dev`, never use `npx prisma db push`.

### Icons

- Prefer `lucide-react`; name icons in PascalCase.
- Custom icons in `src/components/icons`.

### Next.js Structure

- Use App Router in `app/`. Server components by default, `"use client"` for client logic.
- NextAuth + Prisma for auth. `.env` for secrets.

### TypeScript & Syntax

- Strict mode. Avoid `any`.
- Use optional chaining, union types (no enums).

### File & Folder Names

- Next.js routes in kebab-case (e.g. `app/dashboard/page.tsx`).
- Shared types in `src/lib/types.ts`.
- Sort imports (external → internal → sibling → styles).

### AI

- Use OpenAI for all AI calls.
- Use GPT-4.1 model for streaming and o3 model for reasoning.

### Storybook

- Place stories in `src/stories` with `.stories.tsx` extension.
- One story file per component, matching component name.
- Use autodocs for automatic documentation.
- Include multiple variants and sizes in stories.
- Test interactive features with actions.
- Use relative imports from component directory.

### Additional

- Keep code short; commits semantic.

### Testing

Never stop or restart the user’s dev server.
- Before running tests or verifications, open a new terminal and start:  
   - PORT=4001 npm run dev -- -p 4001  # use its own port  (keep it running in the background).
   - Wait until http://localhost:4001 responds with HTTP 200, then continue.  
   - Execute all checks/test-suites against http://localhost:4001.  
   - After verification, kill only the process you started (grep “PORT=4001”).
