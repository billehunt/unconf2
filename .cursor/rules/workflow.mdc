# Workflow Rules

## High-Level Goal
Cursor must pull the next **“To Do”** story from the `.tasks.md` file and drive it to **Completed**, log it, mark it completed and commit the work, **and only then** wait for user review.  
It must **never** pause after individual tasks or subtasks.

---

### Story Completion
1. When every task is **Completed**, build the project and fix errors:  

        npm run build

2. Append to `.cursor-updates`:  in markdown format:
   - a H1 one-sentence summary of changes you made
   - a concise note to yourself of what you would do differently if you performed this task again. This should be in a format that could be added to your rules, for future projects.

3. Update the `.tasks.md` file checking off the task that's been completed.

4. Update git with `git add . && git commit -m "..."`.

### Halting Condition

- Cursor must **never stop or ask for review** after a task or subtask.  
- It halts **only after** the entire *Story Completion* sequence (steps 1-4 above) is finished, then awaits further user input.

---

### Git

- Follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, …).

### Important

- A story is not “done” until the build passes. Run `npm run build` and resolve errors **before** completing the story.
